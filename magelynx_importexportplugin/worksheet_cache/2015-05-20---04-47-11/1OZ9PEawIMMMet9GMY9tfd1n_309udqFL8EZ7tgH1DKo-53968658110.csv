 <p><strong>How You Save with Prosto:</strong></p>
 <p>Our glass is cut in bulk to save on costly manufacturing expenses.&nbsp; We also keep a lean inventory, but provide a huge range of size configurations to fit almost any opening.&nbsp; We pass these cost savings over to you, and in the end, it&rsquo;s half the cost of custom glass. &nbsp;</p>

 <p>- All panels are 3/8"" thick (10mm), clear, premium tempered glass</p>
 <p>- Doors/A panels are pre-drilled for hardware.&nbsp; A panels are symmetrical, to hinge on either side to swing open in either direction.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>- B panels (if included in your shower configuration) are predrilled for glass-to-glass hinges to attach A panel</p>
 <p>- C panels (if included in your shower configuration) will attach to the other wall; either at a 90 degree angle for a corner shower, or on the opposite wall for enclave/straight enclosures.</p>

 <p>- C panels (if included in your shower configuration) will attach to the other wall; either at a 90 degree angle for a corner shower, or on the opposite wall for enclave/straight enclosures.</p>
